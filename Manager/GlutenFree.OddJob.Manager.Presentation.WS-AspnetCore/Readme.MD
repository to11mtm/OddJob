# OddJob Manager - WebSharper Sample

This is a Sample project, Providing a Basic Job Manager using WebSharper alongside ASP.NET Core.

The inspiration for this was the desire to provide some capabilities to manage and observe Job States, and to try WebSharper as a framework.

Consider it something in between 'Batteries Included', 'Project Template', and 'Cautionary Tale'.

Some Important Notes:

 - Websharper Remoting rules mean that Remoting classes are treated as *singletons*. Unfortunately this means this POC doesn't easily translate into certain usage scenarios.
